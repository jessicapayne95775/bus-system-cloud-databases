# Overview

In this project I was learning the basics of using a cloud data base using firestore by Google. I was using python to make the integration more familiar for me as python is my most experienced programming language so far. This project is a mock bus pass system that allows for the individual to create an account, sign in, or change their password. In future versions of this software, I am hoping to implement an auto expiration of the pass and an option to change it back to current instead of expired. I also wanted to work more on creating an authentication system which I was able to do through this project.

# Development Environment

I used Google's firestore cloud data base to implement a learning environment. I was able to use Visual Studio Code with Python to install firestore_admin into my software and use the framework. I am using GitHub as my version control so my work does not get lost.
